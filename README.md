LedgerLy backend API – Women Techsters Fellowship Capstone Project
Ledgerly backend powers a mobile app for retail SME owners in Nigeria, automatically calculating financial metrics (revenue, expenses, profit, margins), storing data, and generating AI-powered plain-language explanations of business performance.

The backend handles transaction logging, profitability calculations, product insights, and AI interpretation so the app delivers simple, actionable financial clarity to non-expert users.
